# How to Design Programs, 2nd edition

This is like a modern version of *How to Solve It* by Polya:

Platform: Fedora Linux 36 (Workstation Edition) with GNOME Wayland

Installation:

`````
$ sudo ./racket-8.5-x86_64-linux-cs.sh
This program will extract and install Racket v8.5.

Note: the required diskspace for this installation is 666M.

Do you want a Unix-style distribution?
  In this distribution mode files go into different directories according
  to Unix conventions.  A "racket-uninstall" script will be generated
  to be used when you want to remove the installation.  If you say 'no',
  the whole Racket directory is kept in a single installation directory
  (movable and erasable), possibly with external links into it -- this is
  often more convenient, especially if you want to install multiple
  versions or keep it in your home directory.
Enter yes/no (default: no) > yes

Where do you want to base your installation of Racket v8.5?
  (If you've done such an installation in the past, either
   enter the same directory, or run 'racket-uninstall' manually.)
  1 - /usr/... [default]
  2 - /usr/local/...
  3 - ~/... (/root/...)
  4 - ./... (here)
  Or enter a different directory prefix to install in.

Target Directories:
  [e] Executables      /usr/bin (exists)
  [o] Libraries        /usr/lib/racket (will be created)
  [s] Shared files     /usr/share/racket (will be created)
  [c] Configuration    /usr/etc/racket (will be created)
  [d] Documentation    /usr/share/racket/doc (will be created)
  [a] .desktop files   /usr/share/applications (exists)
  [m] Man Pages        /usr/share/man (exists)
  [l] C Libraries      /usr/lib (exists)
  [h] C headers        /usr/include/racket (will be created)
  [z] Compiled at lib? yes
Enter a letter to change an entry, or enter to continue.

Checking the integrity of the binary archive... ok.
Unpacking into "/usr/racket-tmp-install" (Ctrl+C to abort)...
Done.

For the Parts I and II we will be working with Beginning Student Language (BSL).

<!-----
### The basic steps of a function design recipe
1. **From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions:** Identify the information that must be represented and how it is represented in the chosen programming language. Formulate data defintions and illustrate them with examples.

2. **Signature, Purpose Statement, Header:** State what kind of data the desired function consumes and produces. Formulate a concise answer to the question *what* the function computes. Define a stub that lives up to the signature.

3. **Functional Examples:** Work through examples that illustrate the function's purpose.

4. **Function Template:** Translate the data defintions into an outline of the function.

5. **Function Definition:** Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the purpose statement and the examples.

6. **Testing:** Articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the function passes all. Doing so discovers mistakes. Tests also supplement examples in that they help others read and understand the definitions when the need arises--and it will arise for any serious program.
