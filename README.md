# How to Design Programs, 2nd edition

I read the Parts I and II of the book. It involves working with Beginning Student Language (BSL) in DrRacket.

According to HtDP, programs are collections of definitions: structure type definitions, data definitions, constant definitions, and function definitions. To guide the division of labor among functions, the following rough guidelines are available:
  - ([chapter 3](https://htdp.org/2022-2-9/Book/part_one.html#%28part._ch~3ahtdp%29)) Design one function per task. Formulate auxiliary function definitions for every dependency between quantities in the problem.
  - ([chapter 11](https://htdp.org/2022-2-9/Book/part_two.html#%28part._sec~3acompounding2%29)) Design one template per data definition. Formulate auxiliary function definitions when one data definition points to a second data definition.
  - ([chapter 3](https://htdp.org/2022-2-9/Book/part_one.html#%28counter._.D.K._%28figure._fig~3aworld-signatures%29%29) and [chapter 11](https://htdp.org/2022-2-9/Book/part_two.html#%28part._sec~3acompounding2%29)) Maintain a *wish list* of function headers that must be designed to complete a program. Before adding a function to the wish list, check whether something like the function already exists in the programming language’s library or whether something similar is already on the wish list.
  - And don’t forget tests. 
 
Writing down complete function headers ensures that you can test those portions of the programs that you have finished, which is useful even though many tests will fail. Of course, when the wish list is empty, all tests should pass and all functions should be covered by tests. 

For example, consider the [implementation of insertion sort in BSL+](https://htdp.org/2022-2-9/Book/part_two.html#%28part._sec~3asort.I%29):

````racket
; List-of-numbers -> List-of-numbers
; produces a sorted version of l
(check-expect (sort> (list 5 2 4 6 1 3)) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6))
(define (sort> l)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) '()]
    [(cons? l) (insert (first l) (sort> (rest l)))]))
 
; Number List-of-numbers -> List-of-numbers
; inserts n into the sorted list of numbers l
(check-expect (insert 4 (list 1 3 6)) (list 1 3 4 6))
(define (insert n l)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) (cons n '())]
    [else (if (<= n (first l))
              (cons n l)
              (cons (first l) (insert n (rest l))))]))
 ````

This is a [pure recursive form](http://www.cs.ecu.edu/karl/2530/fall19/Notes/lec43A.html) (functional/declarative programming) of the [usual iterative form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort#List_insertion_sort_code_in_C) (procedural/imperative programming), we see in C:
````C
struct LIST * SortList1(struct LIST * pList) 
{
    // zero or one element in list
    if (pList == NULL || pList->pNext == NULL)
        return pList;
    // head is the first element of resulting sorted list
    struct LIST * head = NULL;
    while (pList != NULL) {
        struct LIST * current = pList;
        pList = pList->pNext;
        if (head == NULL || current->iValue < head->iValue) {
            // insert into the head of the sorted list
            // or as the first element into an empty sorted list
            current->pNext = head;
            head = current;
        } else {
            // insert current element into proper position in non-empty sorted list
            struct LIST * p = head;
            while (p != NULL) {
                if (p->pNext == NULL || // last element of the sorted list
                    current->iValue < p->pNext->iValue) // middle of the list
                {
                    // insert into middle of the sorted list or as the last element
                    current->pNext = p->pNext;
                    p->pNext = current;
                    break; // done
                }
                p = p->pNext;
            }
        }
    }
    return head;
}

For more information, I would recommend reading [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com/) by Matthew Butterick.

Platform: Fedora Linux 36 (Workstation Edition) with GNOME Wayland

DrRacket Installation:

`````
$ sudo ./racket-8.5-x86_64-linux-cs.sh
This program will extract and install Racket v8.5.

Note: the required diskspace for this installation is 666M.

Do you want a Unix-style distribution?
  In this distribution mode files go into different directories according
  to Unix conventions.  A "racket-uninstall" script will be generated
  to be used when you want to remove the installation.  If you say 'no',
  the whole Racket directory is kept in a single installation directory
  (movable and erasable), possibly with external links into it -- this is
  often more convenient, especially if you want to install multiple
  versions or keep it in your home directory.
Enter yes/no (default: no) > yes

Where do you want to base your installation of Racket v8.5?
  (If you've done such an installation in the past, either
   enter the same directory, or run 'racket-uninstall' manually.)
  1 - /usr/... [default]
  2 - /usr/local/...
  3 - ~/... (/root/...)
  4 - ./... (here)
  Or enter a different directory prefix to install in.

<!-----
### The basic steps of a function design recipe
1. **From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions:** Identify the information that must be represented and how it is represented in the chosen programming language. Formulate data defintions and illustrate them with examples.

2. **Signature, Purpose Statement, Header:** State what kind of data the desired function consumes and produces. Formulate a concise answer to the question *what* the function computes. Define a stub that lives up to the signature.

3. **Functional Examples:** Work through examples that illustrate the function's purpose.

4. **Function Template:** Translate the data defintions into an outline of the function.

5. **Function Definition:** Fill in the gaps in the function template. Exploit the purpose statement and the examples.

6. **Testing:** Articulate the examples as tests and ensure that the function passes all. Doing so discovers mistakes. Tests also supplement examples in that they help others read and understand the definitions when the need arises--and it will arise for any serious program.
